# s_trings

This is going to be the collection of functions I'm using while playing around
with structs that hold info about an array. To be constantly updated, and also
let it be that for personal projects I will use these strings instead of using
arrays, for as long as there is not a limit of the amount of .c file I can use

Hopefully I stick to this because the motivation I've received in the past day
is just astonishing, all the love and shoutout to my peers be them old or new:
Tbornema, Jkrumm, Mrizakov, Mihempel, Mcutura, Mmanley-, Dwilke, Bschmidt, and
least but not least Ltreser who got me painfully aware of my bad sleep habits,
plus the one&only Mspeckens who got me painfully deep into bad sleeping habits

Shoutout to N for the support messages I keep discovering inside my agenda. It
feels like every time I am turning the page I am about to win the lottery, the
one gift that keeps on giving.

Let's see for how long I'm able to ride this motivation wave!
